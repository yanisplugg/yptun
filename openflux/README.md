# OpenFlux

**English** | [Русский](README.ru.md)

Network stack research tool. IPv4 TCP/UDP tunnel with pluggable transports
(including a signed JS scripting engine for writing new ones), a batched +
zstd codec, and two exit-node backends (L3 raw forward / L4 gVisor proxy).

## How it works

```
Client (any):  macOS (utun) / Linux / Windows / iOS (packet tunnel) / Android
                    |
                    v
               Transport (Yandex.Docs / Volga / Board / MAX / Cups / Mail.ru / Direct / script)
                    |
                    v
               Exit node  -->  Internet
                 --mode l3   (raw SNAT/DNAT, Linux + root)
                 --mode l4   (gVisor proxy, any platform)
```

Any client works with either exit backend; `--mode` is chosen on the exit
node, not the client. `l3` forwards raw TCP/UDP with SNAT/DNAT and stays
end-to-end (Linux + root only); `l4` terminates TCP/UDP in a userspace
gVisor stack and re-dials the real server (any OS, no root). A
multi-transport session can run several transports at once and fail over
between them. Full depth: [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Quickstart

```bash
go mod tidy
go build -o openflux .

# Exit node, L4 backend (any OS, no root)
./openflux --role=exit --mode=l4 --transport=yandex --url="YOUR_YANDEX_DOC_URL"

# Client, SOCKS5 (point a browser at 127.0.0.1:1080)
./openflux --role=client --inbound=socks5 --transport=yandex --url="YOUR_YANDEX_DOC_URL"
```

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the `l3` (root,
Linux-only, faster) backend and the macOS/Windows full-tunnel clients, and
[docs/cli-reference.md](docs/cli-reference.md) for every flag.

## Highlights

- **Pluggable native transports** - Yandex.Docs, Yandex Volga, Yandex Board,
  MAX/OneMe, Cups.online, Mail.ru Docs, Direct.
- **Scripted transports** - a signed JS engine (`transport/script`, goja)
  for writing new transports without touching Go or rebuilding the core.
  See [docs/scripted-transports.md](docs/scripted-transports.md).
- **Multi-transport sessions** with authenticated negotiation, encryption
  and failover. See [docs/sessions.md](docs/sessions.md).
- **Two exit backends** - `l3` (raw SNAT/DNAT) and `l4` (gVisor proxy).
  See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).
- **Mode without a server** - the exit can be a small PHP program on any
  web hosting instead of a VDS. See [docs/phpbox.md](docs/phpbox.md).
- **Node provisioning wizard** - `--node-wizard` installs an exit on a VDS
  over SSH, non-interactively, from a desktop app.
  See [docs/node-provisioning.md](docs/node-provisioning.md).
- **Shareable links and QR codes** - an `openflux://` link carries a full
  client configuration. See [docs/links.md](docs/links.md).
- **Captcha handling**, **batched + zstd codec** (with a legacy per-packet
  fallback), **optional AES-256-GCM encryption**, and **benchmark modes**
  for raw goodput. See [docs/transports.md](docs/transports.md) and
  [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## What's in this repo

- `docs/` - the guides above.
- `transport/` - every transport (native and scripted) and the session
  manager.
- `tunnel/` - the client-side virtual NIC and both exit backends.
- `provision/` - the SSH node-provisioning backend and the no-VPS PHP
  deployer.
- `deploy/` - the VDS installer script and the PHP exit's own sources.
- `share/` - the `openflux://` link format.
- `socks5/`, `netbind/`, `utils/` - the SOCKS5 server, Windows interface
  binding, and logging.
- `mobile/`, `ios-app/` - the Android/iOS bridges and the SwiftUI iOS app.
- `.github/workflows/` - CI and the three release channels (tagged,
  exit-node, nightly).

## Requirements

1. **Go** - see `go.mod` for the exact version.
2. **Android NDK r27+** / **Xcode 26.6+** - only for the mobile client binaries.
3. **A Linux VPS / VDS** for a VPS-hosted exit node (not needed for the
   no-VPS PHP exit - [docs/phpbox.md](docs/phpbox.md)). `l3` needs root;
   `l4` doesn't.

## Status

The core tunnel path (native transports, the `l3`/`l4` exit backends,
multi-transport sessions, encryption/negotiation) is CI-tested on every
push and has shipped across several tagged releases - see
`CHANGELOG.md`. The scripted-transport engine and the no-VPS PHP exit are
newer and still gaining real-world coverage; a Windows/macOS native `l3`
exit backend is not implemented yet (the working fallback is `l4` on both).
The nightly prerelease channel (`.github/workflows/nightly.yml`) tracks
the `nightly` branch for anyone who wants a current build ahead of the
next tagged release.
