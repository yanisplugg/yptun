# Architecture

## The path a packet takes

Any client works with either exit backend. `--mode` is chosen on the
**exit node**, not on the client.

```
Client (any):  macOS (utun) / Linux / Windows / iOS (packet tunnel) / Android
                    |
                    v
               Transport (Yandex.Docs / Volga / Board / MAX / Cups / Mail.ru / Direct / script)
                    |
                    v
               Exit node  -->  Internet
                 --mode l3   (raw SNAT/DNAT, Linux + root)
                 --mode l4   (gVisor proxy, any platform)
```

The client terminates TCP locally (gVisor, utun, or NEPacketTunnelProvider),
then sends raw IP packets into the transport. In a multi-transport session
several transports run at once and traffic fails over between them - see
[sessions.md](sessions.md).

## Exit-node backends

The exit node has exactly **two** backends, selected with `--mode` on the
**exit node**. The client does not choose a backend - the same client works
against either.

| `--mode` | Backend | Forwarding | Requires | Platforms |
|----------|---------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| `l3` | Raw L3 | SNAT/DNAT on raw IPv4 via SOCK_RAW + conntrack. No userspace TCP stack. | root / CAP_NET_RAW | Linux only |
| `l4` (alias `proxy`) | gVisor proxy | Terminates TCP/UDP in a userspace gVisor stack, then dials the real server. | nothing | Linux, macOS, Windows |

- `proxy` is a deprecated alias for `l4`; both select the same backend.
  `l4` is the canonical name going forward.
- **l3 is faster** (single end-to-end TCP connection, no double termination)
  but Linux-only and needs root.
- **l4 works everywhere** without root, at the cost of terminating TCP twice
  (client -> gVisor on exit -> real server).
- On Linux with root, prefer `l3`. On Windows, the intended path is `l3`
  inside a lightweight QEMU VM (see [Known limitations](#known-limitations))
  - the WinDivert backend is not wired yet, and `l4` is the working
  fallback until then. On non-root hosts, use `l4`.

### l3 and kernel RSTs

In `l3` mode the kernel sees return packets for connections it never opened
and emits RSTs, tearing the tunnel connections down. Drop them:

```
# Scoped (recommended): assign a dedicated egress IP, run with --local-ip, then:
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags RST RST -s <egress-ip> -j DROP

# Host-wide fallback (drops ALL outbound RST; makes closed ports look filtered):
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags RST RST -j DROP
```

Client-originated RSTs are forwarded normally. The rule above is only for
RSTs generated locally by the exit-node kernel.

## Client inbounds

- **macOS utun** - `--inbound=tun` (default on macOS). Creates a utun
  interface, watches its own sockets to install bypass routes, then takes
  the default route. No SOCKS5, no gVisor on the client.
- **Windows tun** - `--inbound=tun` on Windows uses a Wintun adapter (needs
  administrator and `wintun.dll` next to the binary) for the same
  full-tunnel behavior as the macOS client: the core's own sockets are
  bound to the real interface (see `netbind/`) so carriers never loop into
  the tunnel, IPv6 is routed into the adapter and dropped so programs fall
  back to IPv4, and the routes only live as long as the adapter.
- **SOCKS5** - `--inbound=socks5` (default on non-macOS platforms). Point a
  browser or app at `127.0.0.1:1080`. UDP-capable applications may use the
  SOCKS5 `UDP ASSOCIATE` command. `--http-proxy=<addr>` additionally serves
  a plain HTTP proxy (CONNECT and plain requests) through the same tunnel.
- **iOS packet tunnel** - NEPacketTunnelProvider, pure L3 forwarding.

`netbind/` is what keeps the core's *own* connections (to Yandex, to a
direct exit, etc.) off its own tunnel on Windows: every outbound socket is
bound to the interface that currently carries the default route
(`IP_UNICAST_IF`), the same role Android's VPN-exclude and iOS's extension
sandboxing play on those platforms.

## UDP limitations

- UDP is IPv4-only for now.
- L3 reassembles IPv4 fragments with a 30-second fixed lifetime, 64 incomplete
  datagrams, 128 fragments per datagram and a 4 MiB byte budget per direction.
  Overlaps and malformed fragments are discarded; expiry is swept on input.
- L3 relays checksum-validated ICMP errors only for live TCP/UDP NAT flows,
  restoring the quoted client address/port and checksums. Redirects and echo
  traffic are not relayed. Egress EMSGSIZE produces ICMP fragmentation-needed
  with the kernel route MTU; non-DF packets can instead be fragmented. Outgoing
  fragmentation of IPv4 headers containing options is not supported.
- This is ICMP-based PMTU feedback, not active DPLPMTUD probing. Networks that
  filter ICMP can still black-hole large DF packets; real-network tests remain
  necessary. The negotiated packet ceiling is distinct from the Internet MTU.
- Linux raw L3 UDP reserves a kernel-selected source port per remote endpoint
  using a real UDP socket and restores the client's port on return. This avoids
  taking ports owned by host applications and is intended to prevent kernel
  ICMP port-unreachable without firewall changes. There are at most 256 mappings;
  idle expiry is 2 minutes (15 seconds for DNS). Source-port preservation and
  endpoint-independent NAT/hole-punching are not provided.
- The isolated Linux raw-socket/ICMP test passes in GitHub Actions (`ci.yml`).
  It covers loopback inside a disposable network namespace, including
  host-port conflicts and false ICMP port-unreachable responses; it is not an
  Internet/PMTU canary. TCP's existing raw-port ownership and
  RST-suppression requirements are unchanged.
- iOS keeps the old TCP fallback for non-DNS UDP unless the app explicitly
  calls `OpenFluxTunSetUDPEnabled(1)` for a known UDP-capable exit. Reset it to
  `0` when switching to an older exit. Physical-device QUIC is not validated.
- Most document/WebSocket transports are reliable and ordered. UDP works over
  them, but packet loss in the carrier can still cause head-of-line blocking;
  this is not equivalent to a native datagram transport.

## Benchmarks

Measure raw goodput through the transport, without touching the host network:

```bash
# Sender: push 100 MB
./openflux --role=bench-send --bench-bytes=100 --transport=yandex --url="..."

# Receiver: measure goodput
./openflux --role=bench-sink --transport=yandex --url="..."
```

## Known limitations

- **L3 exit on Windows and macOS.** The L3 exit currently works on Linux
  (SOCK_RAW) only; Windows and macOS use `--mode=l4`. The `tunnel/windivert/`
  package (Windows) exists but is not wired to the L3 forwarder yet. A native
  macOS L3 exit is not implemented.
- **Run the exit node under QEMU** (for a Windows `l3` path) is planned, not built yet.
